# Feedback

## Did the design meet the client requirements?

The design closely followed the clients requirements when thinking about the UX
of the program, including messages to help the user whenever possible.

## The initial design was peer reviewed, and feedback provided. Did this change your design or the way that you implemented the design? What did change?

## Did the UX testing highlight any possible improvements that could be made. Did the user testing uncover any bugs not detected in your functional testing?

## Anything that you would like to do differently or something that you thought worked well and you would do again?

- The application relying on Tauri for its development went well as it
  intergrated with the an OS' existing tooling.
- Cargo made installing and testing different libraries easy across different platforms, making iterations quicker.
